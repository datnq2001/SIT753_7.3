## 🎯 Pipeline Execution Flow

### Automatic Triggers
- **Git Push**: Automatic build on code changes
- **Scheduled**: SCM polling every 5 minutes  
- **Manual**: Build Now button in Jenkins

### Branch-Specific Behavior
```yaml
main branch:
  - Full 8-stage pipeline
  - Production release with approval
  - Complete quality gates

develop/staging:
  - 7 stages (no production release)
  - Automatic staging deployment
  - All quality validations

feature branches:
  - 5 stages (build, test, quality check)
  - No deployment stages
  - Quality gate validation only
```

### Expected Timeline
```
🔄 Checkout: ~30 seconds
🚀 Build: ~2-3 minutes  
🧪 Test: ~3-5 minutes (parallel execution)
📋 Code Quality: ~2-4 minutes (parallel execution)
🔒 Security: ~3-7 minutes (parallel execution)
🚀 Deploy: ~2-3 minutes (parallel execution)
🎯 Release: ~1-2 minutes (with approval)
📊 Monitoring: ~1-2 minutes (parallel execution)

TOTAL DURATION: 15-25 minutes
```
